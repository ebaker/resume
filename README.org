*** About resume repo

I want to give a HUGE thanks to [[https://github.com/punchagan][punchagan]] for starting me off with his [[https://github.com/punchagan/resume][resume]] repo.

Uses [[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] and a custom style sheet.  Every CV/Resume package has
it's own environments and it's a big pain to combine them and
customize them.  I figured, it would be easy to write my own
style-sheet and use good old org-mode.
